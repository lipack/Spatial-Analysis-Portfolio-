# Introduction
This portfolio comprises a sampling of maps created during a six-week module, "Spatial Analysis," at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in the fall of 2021. Each map highlights a skill, or skills, that demonstrate proficiency in analyzing and mapping geospatial data in R. 

# Displaying Multiple Vector Layers 

This map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Load spatial datasets from a file
* Load a basemap image from the rosm package, using the ggspatial package

## Cambridge

# Georeferencing

This georeferenced map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Georeferencing a raster image

## San Francisco
